A level's XML document is fairly simple, and is defined by the following tags:

<Level>:
Whatever's contained inside is what's loaded into the script. Can have the following attributes:

"level"
The ID of this level.

Inside there can only be <Objects>:
  <Object>:
  Represents an object to be loaded. Can have the following attributes:

  "offset"
  How much further to the right should the object be spawned.

  Can have the following inner tags:
    <Prefab>:
    The name of the Unity prefab to use for this object.
    <Distance>(optional):
    How far along the level this object should be spawned. Defaults to 0.
    <Height>(optional):
    At what height the object should be spawned. Defaults to 0.
    <Speed>(optional):
    The speed the object should be spawned with. Defaults to 5.

    There are some special cases where an object may have inner tags representing more objects. These are:
      <Link>:
      Parsed when inside a Switch object. Same tags as a normal object. Intended so that the object calls Activate() when the switch is triggered.
      <Switch>:
      Parsed when inside a Gate object. Same tags as a normal object. Intended so that the gate opens a bit when the switch is triggered.
